# web_vpn_public beta 0.1
This is webgui app for openvpn.
For deploy server need. 
1.requirements.txt (in directory hotvpn)
2. Gunicorn
3. nginx

I think you cannot deploy because this public repository for demostration of code and some functions deleted.=)


P.S I took template from https://startbootstrap.com/themes/sb-admin-2/ and little bit change for my goals
